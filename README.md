TaskFlow - A Modern Kanban-style Task Manager
TaskFlow is a clean, responsive, and intuitive task management application designed to help you organize your work and stay productive. Built with modern web technologies, it provides a powerful yet simple Kanban board experience right in your browser.

‚ú® Features
Kanban Board: Organize tasks into three customizable columns: To Do, In Progress, and Done.

Drag-and-Drop: Easily move tasks between columns with a fluid and responsive drag-and-drop interface.

Persistent Storage: All your tasks are automatically saved in your browser's local storage, so your work is safe even after you close the tab.

Task Details: Add rich information to each task, including a title, description, type (Story, Bug, Epic, etc.), priority, and assignee.

Light & Dark Mode: Switch between a professional light theme and a sleek dark theme with a single click.

Search & Filter: Quickly find specific tasks using the integrated search bar.

Responsive Design: The interface adapts seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
